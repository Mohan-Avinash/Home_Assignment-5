| -------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Q1*   | GAN Architecture                | Explained the generator–discriminator dynamics with architecture diagram.    |
| *Q2*   | Ethics and AI Harm              | Analyzed representational harm in AI and proposed two mitigation strategies. |
| *Q3*   | Basic GAN Implementation        | Built a simple GAN in PyTorch to generate MNIST digits with loss tracking.   |
| *Q4*   | Data Poisoning Simulation       | Simulated a poisoning attack on a sentiment classifier using label flipping. |
| *Q5*   | Legal & Ethical Issues in GenAI | Discussed concerns around data memorization and copyright in GenAI.          |
| *Q6*   | Bias & Fairness (Aequitas Tool) | Evaluated False Negative Rate Parity and explained its impact on fairness.   |
